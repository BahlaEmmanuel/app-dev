> "If I possess a radiant aura of life, it is not to sail this ship, but to see that girl’s smile. And if I wield a knife, it is to protect her". ~Takuto Tsunashi (Star Driver)
> “I'm not going to protect you by being your shield or armor, but I'll be the dagger hidden below your pillow.” ― ishida sui (Tokyo Ghoul)
